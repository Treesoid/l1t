# l1t

A terminal game where you move lasers around a grid to light up statues.
Light up all the statues in a level to complete the level.

## Progress

***NOTE***: This project is still in development and is not yet ready for
full gameplay. Thank you for being patient with me.

All current "gameplay" is done in `Level 0` right now which is the development
playground for level making. Any items in that level are purely for testing
and there is no way, right now, to "win" `Level 0`.
